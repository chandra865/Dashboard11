# Insurance Claim Dashboard UI (Frontend)

## Project Overview
The Insurance Claim Dashboard UI is a responsive frontend web application built using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**. This dashboard allows users to manage their insurance claims, including viewing cases, uploading files, tracking activities, and submitting disputes. The dashboard offers an intuitive experience for users at every step of the claim process.

## Approach to Building the Dashboard

The dashboard was designed to be clean, responsive, and easy to navigate. With **React**, we focused on building reusable components that could handle dynamic user interactions and data. **Tailwind CSS** was chosen for its utility-first approach, allowing for rapid styling and flexible layouts.

### Key Sections of the Dashboard:
1. **Dashboard:** Displays an overview of the user’s current claim status, progress, and important updates.
2. **My Cases:** A section where users can view their ongoing and past claims, including the status of each claim.
3. **Activities:** Lists recent activities related to the claims, such as updates, communications, and actions taken.
4. **Files:** Allows users to upload and view supporting documents for their claims.
5. **Open a Dispute:** Enables users to file a dispute if they are unsatisfied with their claim’s resolution.
6. **Get Justice:** Provides users with guidance on the next steps and options for claiming justice.
7. **Preliminary Step:** For gathering the initial claim details and guiding users through the claim process.
8. **Your Details:** Section for entering and editing personal details necessary for the claim.
9. **Claim Value & Dispute Value:** Users can enter the estimated value of their claim and dispute value.
10. **Statement:** A section for submitting a written statement to support the claim.
11. **Parties Involved:** Allows users to specify the parties involved in the claim.
12. **Agreement Under Disputes:** Includes any agreements related to disputes and claim processing.
13. **Additional Documentation:** A section for users to upload any other required documents.

### Technologies Used:
- **React.js:** Used for dynamic rendering of claim data and handling user interactions.
- **Tailwind CSS:** For responsive and flexible design, making the UI highly customizable.

## Challenges Faced and Solutions

**Responsive Layout Across Devices:**
   - **Challenge:** Ensuring that the dashboard remains visually appealing and functional across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
   - **Solution:** Utilized Tailwind CSS’s responsive classes and custom media queries to create a layout that adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes.



## Assumptions Made
- The application is intended to function as a frontend only, and does not include actual data fetching or API integration.
- Authentication and backend integration are not part of this version but can be added later.
- The dashboard assumes that users are familiar with basic insurance claim terminology and processes.
